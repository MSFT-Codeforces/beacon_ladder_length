You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in Python. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable Python program in a python codeblock.

**Beacon Ladder Length**

In the underground city of Arkhaven, engineers place beacons along a tunnel. Each beacon is assigned an integer frequency, forming a sequence $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$.

The sequence must be a **beacon ladder**, meaning:

1. Frequencies strictly increase:
   $$a_{i-1} < a_i \quad \text{for all } 2 \le i \le n$$
2. The gaps between consecutive frequencies also strictly increase:
   $$(a_i-a_{i-1}) < (a_{i+1}-a_i) \quad \text{for all } 2 \le i < n$$

For each test case, you are given integers $l$, $r$, and $S$ such that:

- Every frequency must satisfy $l \le a_i \le r$
- The total power used must satisfy $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \le S$

For each test case, determine the **maximum possible length** $n$ of a beacon ladder.

**Input Format:-**

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases.  
Each of the next $t$ lines contains three integers $l$, $r$, $S$.

**Output Format:-**

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum feasible $n$.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le t \le 10^4$
- $1 \le l \le r \le 10^{18}$
- $l \le S \le 10^{18}$

**Examples:-**
 - **Input:**
```

1 10 30
5 100 60
10 10 10
```

 - **Output:**
